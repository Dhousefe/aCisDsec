Flame Lord Kakai:<br>
Monks are priests who devote themselves to the<br1> path of flame. Unlike Raiders, they do not rely<br1> on swords or large weapons, but use their own<br1> bodies as weapons of war. Because they do not<br1> depend on weapons or armor, they learn many<br1> skills to protect themselves.<br>
The finest Monks are selected to become Tyrants,<br1> for still more advanced physical and technical<br1> training.<br>
